# TestNewIDE
Testing a new JS dev env from cory house's pluralsight tut

# Purpose
Develop my skills and in the end, acquire not only the knowledge but also the concrete starter kit for any future projects I'll start using react and redux

## Steps:
1. Started with a very simple 'empty' git repo
2. Added an editor config file for my chosen editor (vs code)
3. Added package.json
4. Set up some scripts to help automate running the entire process
5. Set up linting rules in a eslint config json file and further extended the npm scripts to include linting as well
6. Added the index.js file as an entry point to the app and actually ran the app on express
7. a) Added webpack and config file
  b) Moved linting rules to the config file
8. Added React and babel (and babel config in the package json) and wrote a component
9. Added Hot Reloading capabilites and configs
10. Added Typescript and with it a tsconfig file
11. Added Material UI and rendered my first mui component 
12. Added Redux to the app and rendered my first redux connected component
